# SkillTree

My work in progress. I'm developing this application to log how many hours you spend learning new skills. My thought process is it takes 10,000 hours to master a new skill, so why not keep track of how far you've gone? I'm practicing clean architecture and starting to add TDD practices to this project. Also I'm experimenting with Room instead of traditional SQLite Libraries. Eventually I plan to turn this into a social media platform compatible with Instagram and Facebook. I think for cloud storage I'll be using Firebase until I can find something better.
